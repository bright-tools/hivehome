# hivehome
Python module for interacting with Hive home automation

The intent of this module is to act as a wrapper around the AlertMe REST API provided by [HiveHome](https://www.hivehome.com/), simplifying the job of querying the API from Python

## Status

A work in progress.  Currently I'm interested in retrieving particular bits of data relating to the heating system, so that will be the initial focus.

## Example

See [test.py](test.py)
